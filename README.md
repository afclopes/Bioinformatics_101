# Cluster_Work_Journey_Public
Self-taught knowledge on running remote jobs on clusters, bash and command-line writing, parallel computing and python.


I had previously worked with the programming language R since many years. My first exposure to R was when I was in highschool. I created a website where I presented some very basic plots that could be done in R and discussed some very basic terminology. This website can be seen here: https://sites.google.com/site/amandafcl/home . During my bachelors degree, I decided to continue working on R, improving my graphics and plotting, and expanded the website I had created in high school to include two new sections called "Line Graphs" and "Bar Charts". During my Masters and PhD, I neglected my website, although continuously working with R for data graphing and statistical analysis. Now, during my postdoc, I have decided to restart registering my progression in this area. This time, nevertheless, I am interested in learning how to use a cluster, including submitting jobs to be run on the cluster, I am curious to learn shell scripting and also expand my knowledge of programming languages in python and SQL. Here I shall record this journey.
